C# is programming object-oriented language. People can write different types of application in C#.
.Net framework is a software framework oriented primarily for Microsoft Windows. It includes a large library and several programming languages including C#.
Programs written in C# execute in a software environment, which provides .NET Framework.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). 
The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
